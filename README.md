# NOTES
Always use return line even if your function doesnt return anything. if not risk causing a memory leak. Shouldnt change the working of your program tho.

All the words belinging to your language are in CAPS. REMEMBER THAT!

DO NOT PASS ARRAYS TO FUNCTIONS PLEASE. THANKS!! USE THEM FROM MAIN MEMORY DIRECTLY!!

DONT DECLARE ANY VARIABLES INSIDE FUNCTIONS PLEASE??? SORRY BUT PLEASEEEE
